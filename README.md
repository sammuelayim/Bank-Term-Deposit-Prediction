## Introduction
This project aims to develop a predictive model for determining the likelihood of a client subscribing to a financial product, utilizing historical marketing campaign data.

## Data Description
The dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables related to customer demographics and their response to marketing campaigns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis includes visualizations of data distributions, missing values, and correlations between variables.

## Feature Engineering
Identified significant features that impact subscription likelihood, including age, job type, duration of contact, etc.

## Model Building
A logistic regression model was constructed using standard machine-learning practices for binary classification.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.

## Findings and Insights
Key features impacting client subscriptions were identified, with actionable recommendations for the marketing team provided.

## Future Work
Further enhancements could include testing additional algorithms, expanding feature sets, and optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
